## Description
My Project is a simple web application truning on flask that allows users to upload an image. It will then use a CNN model to recognise a face and a human emotion in the image. 

There are currently, there are 7 emotions:

- Fear
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Surprise
- Neutral

There is also a training file for the CNN model and two basic py files for real time recognition and recognition using an image file.
